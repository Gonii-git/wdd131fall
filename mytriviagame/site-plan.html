                Question Randomization: JavaScript will randomly pull questions from the trivia question bank and present them to the user.
                User Input and Validation: JavaScript will handle user responses, validate answers, and provide immediate feedback, such as displaying the correct answer or showing a "Try Again" option for incorrect answers.
                Score Tracking: The score will be dynamically updated based on the user's answers and will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
